# Starbucks-Capstone-Challenge
Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone Project - Analyze Starbucks Capstone Challenge Dataset

# File Descriptions
There is only jupyter notebook available here to showcase work related to the predictions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. This file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict successful transaction. Input data has been clearly marked in the notebook.

The data is contained in three files:
- portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
- profile.json - demographic data for each customer
- transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed


# Problem Statement
The problem statements I am trying to answer are here are:

What are the distributions of gender, age, and income of customers in general?
What are the distributions offer types alone and based on gender, age, and income of customers that completed the offers? 

# Metrics
Create a master dataset that takes the relevant parameters from the Clean Edition as a baseline and joining withÂ :
"Cleaned Profile" (using Customer ID as a common key variable) to get customers' demographic information, such as age, gender, income.
"Cleaned Portfolio" (using Offer ID as the main joining variable) to get offers related information, such as offer type, channels and etc.
As customers' demographic information i.e. age and income are captured in actual value and it's not feasible to analyze based on this continuous numeric value. Therefore, binning is perform on these variables to convert it into a set of discrete buckets for further analysis.

# Installation
To be able to run and view this project. It's recommended to have the latest versions of the followings:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- sklearn
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- datetime

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here https://medium.com/@sarahalkohadir/starbucks-capstone-challenge-e4d3209e4fb3 

# Improvements
To make our results even better, I feel information about customers was limited we only had just age, gender, and income. To find demographic groups respond best to offers, it would better to have more features of the customers.

# Conclusion
we upload the selected data sets, and then we clean and explore the data.
Then it follows this by creating a dataset that consolidates all the required information into one masterpiece and visualizes it in a bar chart for each demographic attribute and compares it with results for different types of offerings.
after analyzing the data, I found the following:
BOGO offers have are more popular as higher completing offers counts and follows Discount offer so you might Starbucks might want to send focus on sending offers of these types.
Males have more offers to complete, so Starbucks may want to send more offers to them.
The elderly age category has a higher count in completing offers so Starbucks might want to send more offers to them.
