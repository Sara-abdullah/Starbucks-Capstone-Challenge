Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone Project - Analyze Starbucks Capstone Challenge Dataset

# File Descriptions
There is only jupyter notebook available here to showcase work related to the predictions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. This file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict successful transaction. Input data has been clearly marked in the notebook.

# Problem Statement
The problem I chose to solve was building a model that predicts whether a customer will respond to an offer. 

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here https://medium.com/@sarahalkohadir/starbucks-capstone-challenge-e4d3209e4fb3
